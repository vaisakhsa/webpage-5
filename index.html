<div id="div"><p>The scanner installed at hospital is having many advanced features like CSF flow study, Dedicated breast coil , Susceptibility weighted imaging (for blood products) etc. In certain cases intravenous contrast many have to be injected for further characterization. Also during scans some knocking noises may be heared. There are due to switching on and off of the special coils in the scanner. Do not get afraid of these noises and our mri personnel will assists you in minimizing it. Very restless patients may have to be sedated while inside the scanner. Movement during scans will degrade the quality of the mri images and hence its important that you don't move while inside the scanner.
